# SQL/DataBase : WholeFoods
<br>

Companies can use AI to collect insightful data and navigation habits directly from consumers and use it for marketing purposes.
Adding badges not only allows businesses to improve users’ interface but also enhances the understanding of customers’ preferences to drive sales and increase profits (Seranmadevi R. &
Felisiya M., 2019). Whole Foods is taking advantage of the use of badges to engage clients and guide them through their shopping experience.
This analysis aims at answering the quesion: Does the amount of badges increase price?
To acquire this insight, I created and analyzed a DataBase on SQL with all the products sold on a specific date on the company's e-commerce.
